                    <h1>How to Choose the Right Kitchen Utensils</h1>
                   <P> The kitchen is where creative processes flourish. Be it the
                recipe that was passed on from generation to generation or
                something new that you tried, it is all part of a creative
                process that originates from the heart and out of love.This
                makes your kitchen the most important part of the home.And as
                such your kitchen should be equipped with the best of the tools
                to ensure that your artistic process is not interrupted.
                </P> 
            <P>There are essential tools and then there are tools that you do not
                probably need but really want. It is very easy to get carried
                away when buying kitchen equipment. Just keep in mind the
                following points before choosing your kitchen utensils and you
                are sure not to go overboard.
            </p>
                   
                    <h1>Do You Need it?</h1>
                 <P>To answer this question, tell us if you have a good-sized
                kitchen or one of those tiny apartment kitchens. A good-sized
                kitchen gives you the creative freedom to pick whatever you
                want.
            </P> 
                <P>But if you have a small kitchen, you might want to give a
                thought and choose only what you would use. Spatulas, spoons
                (stirring and serving), ladles, wire whisk, grater, peeler and
                measuring cups are an absolute must. On the other hand, you also
                have a pizza cutter, zester, masher, etc which can be optional.
                When it comes to pots and pans, kadai of various sizes, frying
                pans and tawas are an absolute must.
            </p>
                    
                    
                    <h1>Is it of Good Quality?</h1>
                    <p>How can you differentiate between an off the rack cheap vessel
                    or utensil and a quality product? It is not quite easy unless
                    you go for branded products like Prestige or Wonderchef. A
                    high-quality product would go for a longer period of time
                    without any need for replacement or repairs. 
                </p> 
                    <p>A quality vessel distributes heat evenly and doesn't scratch easily; A good spoon
                    and ladle would not disturb the coating on your vessel. Invest
                    in a quality product that stays with you for years and
                    throughout your cooking adventure.

                    <h1>Does it Exceed Your Budget?</h1>
                    <p>As with every purchase, plan your budget before jumping the gun.
                        It is not wise to stock your kitchen at the expense of a hole in
                        your purse. Go for the kitchen essentials that you simply cannot
                        do without. As for the rest, reach for cheaper products until
                        you can pitch in for quality products. 
                     </P>   
                     <P>Another tip when on a tight budget is to go for individual products and not a set.
                        Sets can be pretty expensive, but with individual products, you
                        get to choose your most essential needs.
